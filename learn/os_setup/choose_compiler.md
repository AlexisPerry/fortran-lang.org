A comprehensive list of available compilers is provided in this website under [Compilers]({{site.baseurl}}/compilers). In this guide, we will focus only on those that are free to install and use.

Out of those enlisted at the link above, and as of the time of writing this tutorial, open source and free are the following: GFortran (with OpenCoarrays), Flang and LFortran. Finally, the following two are commercial with free-community versions: NVFortran and IFort*. 

_Note_: *IFort (Intel's Fortran Compiler) does not offer a free community edition in general. However, if you are a student, educator, or open-source contributor, you may [qualify for free software](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/qualify-for-free-software.html).

Both NVFortran(NVidia) and IFort(Intel) are very well documented and readers can find detailed information about installing and using them on their websites respectively. In the next chapter, we use GFortran for the tutorial as it is a mature open source compiler. Users are encouraged to also try other open source and commercial compilers.

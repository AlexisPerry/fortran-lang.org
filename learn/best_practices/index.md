This mini-book collects a modern canonical way of doing things in Fortran. It
is meant to be short, and it is assumed that you already know how to
program in other languages (like Python, C/C++, ...) and also know
Fortran syntax a bit. Some things in Fortran are obsolete, so this guide
only shows the "one correct/canonical modern way" how to do things.

Summary of the language:
<http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~squire/fortranclass/summary.shtml>

Language features are explained at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_language_features>

The best resource is a recent Fortran standard, for example the Fortran
2003 standard: <http://www.j3-fortran.org/doc/year/04/04-007.pdf>

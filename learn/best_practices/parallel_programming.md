OpenMP
------

[OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/) should be compatible with non-openMP
compilers. This can be enforced by prepending all OpenMP-specific calls
by `!$`. Regular compilers will consider these lines as comments and
ignore them. For OpenMP compilers, these lines will be considered as
regular Fortran code. The following code :

``` fortran
program test_openmpi
  !$ use omp_lib
  implicit none

  integer :: nthreads

  nthreads = -1
  !$ nthreads = omp_get_num_threads()

  ! will print the number of running threads when compiled with OpenMP, else will print -1
  print*, "nthreads=", nthreads
end program
```

will print the number of threads used when compiled with OpenMP. It will
print by default -1 if compiled without OpenMP.

MPI
---

There are three ways of including MPI in a fortran program:

| Fortran version | Method             | Comments                                                             |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fortran 08      | `use mpi_f08`      | Consistent with F08 standard, good type-checking; highly recommended |
| Fortran 90      | `use mpi`          | Not consistent with standard, so-so type-checking; not recommended   |
| Fortran 77      | `include "mpif.h"` | Not consistent with standard, no type-checking; strongly discouraged |

On infrastructures where `use mpi_f08` is not available, one should
fallback to `use mpi`. The use of `include "mpif.h"` is strongly
discouraged, as it does not check at all the types of the argument or
that the function calls provide the good arguments. For example, you
donâ€™t get any compiler warnings if you call a subroutine and forget a
parameter, add an extra parameter, or pass a parameter of the wrong
type. It may also lead to silent data corruption.

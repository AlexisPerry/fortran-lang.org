## fortran-lang.org

Work has continued on the Fortran-lang website, including a new community page and additional tutorial content:

* [#120](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/pull/120): updated the
  [Book section](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/) with a comprehensive list of
  books about Fortran

Ongoing work:

* [#117](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues/117): Adding a
  Benchmarks section, a new dedicated repository was created at
  https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks and many details have been
  discussed in [issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks/issues) there



[Let us know](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues) if you have any suggestions for the website and its content.
We welcome any new contributors to the website and the tutorials page in particular - see the [contributor guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.


## Fortran Standard Library

What's new in the Fortran Standard Library:


Some miscellaneous fixes and improvements:


## Fortran Package Manager

What's new in fpm:


fpm is still in very early development, and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Try to use it. Does it work? No? Let us know! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/master/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm.
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm.
* Improve the documentation.

The short term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Events
